      What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me

Yeah
I don't know why you're not fair
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Gimme a sign
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

What else can I say, it's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on

    <h4> Skills</h4>
    <p> I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you. Taken</p>
